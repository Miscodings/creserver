                Hi! I'm Cresa, your companion! You're working on a server, aren't you? Or, at least... thinking
                about it? If not, delete this program. Creating a server, though, especially a modern one,
                might seem simple, but there's a lot to know, and it's important for all owners to know what's
                going on under the hood of all the MCModels products you spam-bought. This app is meant to teach you
                how a bunch of different integral parts of Minecraft server development actually work. Enjoy!
            </p>
