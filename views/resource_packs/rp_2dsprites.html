                <h1><u>2D Sprites</u></h1>
                <p>
                    Thankfully, 2D sprites are actually a little easier (in my experience) than 3D models, mainly because 
                    there's one less step involved, and instead, one more config option!
                </p>        
                <p>
                    Item Config → Texture 
                </p>
                <div class="diagram">
                    <div class="diagram-item">
                        <img id="config" src="../../assets/essential_graphics/config-file.png" alt="Config">
                        <p class="diagram-label config-label">Config (.yml)</p>
                    </div>
                    <span class="arrow">→</span>
                    <div class="diagram-item">
                        <img id="texture" src="../../assets/essential_graphics/texture-file.png" alt="Texture">
                        <p class="diagram-label texture-label">Texture (.png)</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    As you can see, there is no longer a model .json file involved, and the item links directly up to a texture in
                    the correct path. The configuration of an item points to the texture that the item should use. However, you now
                    have to let Minecraft know how exactly you want this item to be displayed in your hand.
                </p>
                <h1>Here's An Example:</h1>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <div class="code-header">Nexo/items/skill_icons.yml</div>
                    <pre><code class="language-yaml">
dagger_throw_icon:
material: PAPER
Pack:
  parent_model: item/generated
  textures:
  - skill_icons/dagger_throw
  custom_model_data: 1000</code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
            <p>
                - `dagger_throw_icon` is the <b>ID</b> of the item. Every item has its own, unique <b>ID</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                - The <b>base item</b>, or `material:` that this axe is using is a Paper.
            </p>
            <p>
                - This item does not have a <b>display name</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                - In terms of the pack, it's <b>custom-model-data</b> is being assigned to the number 1,000.
            </p>
            <p>
                The texture path is being assigned to a .png file located in the directory skill_icons/dagger_throw. That's in:
            </p>
            <p>
                Nexo/pack/assets/minecraft/textures/skill_icons/dagger_throw.png
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we move on, let's talk about what `parent_model` means.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
            <h1><u>Parent Models</u></h1>
            <p>
                To put it simply, the `parent_model` configuration option just determines how your item looks when it's held.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may have noticed that holding a FEATHER or a PAPER in your hand, looks different from holding a SWORD
                or a STICK. That's due to the parent_models of those items being different.
            </p>
            <p>
                For items that should be held horizontally like PAPER or FEATHERs, use 'parent_model: item/generated'.
            </p>
            <p>
                For items that should be held vertically like SWORDs or TOOLs, use 'parent_model: item/handheld'.
            </p>
            <img id="cmd-showcase3" src="../../assets/essential_graphics/cmd-showcase3.png" alt="Handheld VS Generated">
            <p>
                So pretty much, if you're creating 2D tools or weapons, item/handheld is the way to go. Otherwise, for like ores 
                and stuff, you're likely going to want to stick with item/generated.
            </p>

            <div style="height: 20px;"></div>

                As you can see, even simpler than the 3D model process. Again, if there's something I missed or you think is 
                confusing, reach out to me on Discord!
