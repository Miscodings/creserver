                    I'm gonna keep it real. If you've gone through the rest of the pages in this section already,
                    you've probably noticed a common trend of how file paths, models, and textures interact with each other.

                    Furniture is too big of a topic within Nexo for me to actually cover in a new groundbreaking way,
                    and I feel like Nexo's wiki does it in the best way possible. So I'm just gonna link you guys to that place.

                    That being said. If there's some part of Furniture creation that you'd really like me to put on here, do not
                    hesitate to let me know!
